<!-- ABOUT THE DATAPACK -->
## About The Datapack

Pathfinder is a datapack that tries to detect paths build with dirt paths, grass, cobblestone etc. and gives a speed boost when walking on them.

The datapack also adds trails, which form when walking on grass near paths often enough. These trails turn the grass into path blocks.

Both features can be enabled or disabled using the functions:
* `pathfinder:speed/enable` and `pathfinder:speed/disable`
* `pathfinder:trails/enable` and `pathfinder:trails/disable`

For more detailed information about the datapacks, please visit the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Racoonia-Datapacks/datapacks/wiki/Pathfinder).
